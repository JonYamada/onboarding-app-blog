# Project Title

A simple training app used for the purposes of on-boarding new developers at WP Engine

## Description

This app is a blogging platform which contains articles. The app will build up many articles over itâ€™s lifetime. To
assist in organising this content, we want to implement an automatic archive system. This will keep the content
organised and easy to browse.

## Getting Started

Ensure `rvm` is installed and install ruby 2.7.4 using `rvm install 2.7.4`\
This project uses postgresql so make sure to run `brew install postgresql` on your machine.

### Installing

`bundle install`\
`yarn`

### Executing program

`rails s`\
`HMR=true bin/webpack-dev-server`\
or run Procfile `foreman start -f Procfile.dev` though this can be temperamental

## Troubleshooting

If you're using a MacBook with the M1 chip, you may run into some architecture errors. Try:

* `arch -x86_64 /bin/zsh` or `arch -arm64 /bin/zsh`.
* You can also trying prefixing your `brew commands` with `arch -x86_64 brew ...`
* `brew doctor` should return `Your system is ready to brew`
